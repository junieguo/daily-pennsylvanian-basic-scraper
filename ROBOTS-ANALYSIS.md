## Explanation

### General Rules for All User Agents
1. **User-agent: \***  
   - The asterisk (`*`) signifies that the directives in this section apply to all web crawlers, except those explicitly specified elsewhere in the file.

2. **Crawl-delay: 10**  
   - This directive instructs bots to wait 10 seconds between consecutive requests to the server. It helps to prevent overloading the server by managing the request rate.

3. **Allow: /**  
   - The `Allow` directive permits all bots to crawl the entire website. The `/` refers to the root directory, which includes all pages and subdirectories.

### Specific Rule for SemrushBot
1. **User-agent: SemrushBot**  
   - This section specifically targets the SemrushBot, which is used for SEO-related crawling and analysis.

2. **Disallow: /**  
   - The `Disallow` directive blocks SemrushBot from crawling any portion of the website. The `/` refers to the root directory, meaning all content is off-limits to this bot.
